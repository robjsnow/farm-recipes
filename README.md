- 4 lamb shanks
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (14 oz) full-fat coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Slow Cooker Lamb Shanks Instructions
1. In a small bowl, mix together the ground cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper.
2. Rub the spice mixture all over the lamb shanks, making sure to coat them evenly.
3. In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the lamb shanks on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.
4. Transfer the lamb shanks to a slow cooker.
5. In the same pan used to brown the lamb shanks, add the minced garlic and tomato paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
6. Add the diced tomatoes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Pour the tomato mixture over the lamb shanks in the slow cooker.

9. Cover the slow cooker and cook on low heat for 8-10 hours, or on high heat for 4-6 hours, until the lamb shanks are tender and falling off the bone. (I did 2-3 hours at 210F in an Emeril Lagasse)
10. Optional: Add sweetener of your choice, to taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed.
11. Serve the lamb shanks with the sauce and your favorite low-carb side dishes.
